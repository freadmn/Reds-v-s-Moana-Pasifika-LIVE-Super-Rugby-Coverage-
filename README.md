Both the Chiefs and Crusaders are coming off impressive wins in the pulsating first weekend of Super Rugby Pacific, so this showdown in Hamilton will really set a gauge on which team will continue their winning ways.
Chiefs coach Clayton McMillan and Crusaders coach Rob Penney have named very strong sides for the match, however not without a few talking points scattered through. The Chiefs are hoping for a big turnout at a venue that traditionally draws very healthy Friday night crowds.
